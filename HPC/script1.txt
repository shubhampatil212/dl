Sure! Here's a simple explanation:

### ❌ Why **not** use parallel bubble sort in real life?

Bubble sort is a very **slow sorting method**. It works by comparing **two numbers at a time** and swapping them if they’re in the wrong order. This process depends on what happened in the previous step.

Now, if you try to make this parallel (run multiple parts at the same time), it becomes **messy** because:

* It still **needs to wait** for other parts to finish before it can continue.
* **Managing threads** (parallel tasks) takes **extra time**.
* The result? It often runs **slower**, not faster.

### ✅ So, where is it used?

Only for **learning** or **practice**, like in your college project — not in real-world software.

In real life, we use **faster sorting methods** like:

* **Merge Sort**
* **Quick Sort**
* **Timsort** (used in Python)

Would you like a simple comparison of these better sorting methods too?


So why is parallel merge sort slower than the normal one?

Here’s the simple reason:
1. Too many threads slow things down

    When you split tasks in #pragma omp parallel sections, it creates new threads.

    For small tasks (like sorting small chunks), thread creation takes more time than the work itself.

2. Overhead of thread management

    Switching between threads, waiting for them to finish, and managing them adds extra cost.

    Your CPU may only have a few cores (e.g., 4 or 8). If you spawn too many threads, they just wait and fight for CPU.

3. Recursive explosion of threads

    Each merge sort split calls itself recursively.
    With #pragma omp section, that means every split tries to go parallel — leading to a huge number of threads.

Simple Explanation: Why too many threads slow things down

Your CPU has limited cores (physical processing units). For example:

    If your laptop has 4 cores, only 4 threads can run truly at the same time (in parallel).

    If you run 100 threads, only 4 run at a time. The other 96 wait in line.
    This creates a "context switching" overhead — the CPU keeps pausing one thread to run another.

➡️ More threads ≠ faster — too many threads = wasted time managing them instead of doing real work.
